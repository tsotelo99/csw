## Date: September 26-27, 2022

In a workshop hosted by the Clements Center for Southwest Studies at SMU in Taos, NM (September 26-27, 2025), we propose anchoring visions of past and future to a deeper planetary archive, one linked to Native nations and Indigenous communities and their historical border crossings world-wide. We seek to connect exciting new work in global Indigenous studies with Native-centered work on place, mobility, climate change and justice, human and other-than-human kinship, migration and sanctuary, borderlands and border crossings, Native trans-national relationships and social movements, and Indigenous politics, identities, diplomacy, and cross-community relations in historical contexts of global change.

Some pictures from the workshop.
